# Scheduler

Description:
This web page provides a daily planner to create a schedule when the user opens the planner
Then the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar
When the user scrolls down the user is presented with timeblocks for standard business hours
The timeblocks forr the day are color coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future
When the user clicks into a timeblock they can enter an event when the user clicks the save button for that timeblock
Then the text for that event is saved in local storage
When the user refreshes the page the saved events persist.
